Introduction: 

The files presented in this folder exhibit the final presentation for my
website project for the semester. The website, 'Rock n' Scroll', aims to 
showcase the history of Australian rock music through information and 
monumental posters found through the Powerhouse Collection.

Reflection: 

Since my website portfolio and prototyping, I have attempted to create the 
site 'Rock n' Scroll' with my original prototypes and ideas in mind. While 
the final production still requires slightly more polishing, I believe it 
best represents what I had initially imagined at the very beginning of the 
assessment. The imagery, the colour scheme and the element placement are, 
for the most part, accurately following the original aesthetic outlined for
the final website. Furthermore, despite a few design and technical issues 
represented through the site and code, it does what it sets out to do: 
demonstrate the evolution and progression of Australian rock music throughout
Australian history. 

In regard to the preliminary prototypes, the final product does not exactly 
line up to the original ideas. Firstly, the content page is much more simple 
than initially intended, and this is because of my lack of coding skill and 
knowledge to be able to undertake such method of presentation. The layout 
settled with is much more simple, but it successfully carries the user through
the pages nonetheless. I am also slightly disappointed with the lack of title
and detail to the navigation bar, as shown in the prototypes. 

When evaluating the design and coding principles themselves, there are some
issues that I had not been able to resolve. One of the largest issues presented
through the site is the choppy transition of the text on the home page. I had 
examined my CSS and HTML to no avail as to what was causing the issue. I also 
wished for a better layout of the posters on my history page, but was unable to 
successfully work around CSS grid. 

In conclusion, while my website accurately exhibits the aesthetic and information
that was intended from the beginning of the assessments, there are some issues
that stand out. Hopefully with some more coding experience and practice, I will
be able to recreate the site into something more smooth and user-friendly.

(ANNOTATION): As a beginner coder, it is extremely useful to have resources that will
provide lengthy and efficient explanations of CSS and HTML coding techniques that I
can either utilise or learn more about. MDN and W3's websites helped in my learning 
about how to do things most efficiently and what a particular part of coding language
means.

parts and discusses in detail the Australian rock development and the influences that

(ANNOTATION): As previously mentioned in the MDN annotation, websites such as this one
was a significant aid in my coding experience. As a coder with only a small background of experience, it is crucial for me to research what each element of code
means so that I learn to the best of my ability. This resource helped me understand
what and why I used what I used for my coding.
