                <div class="historyText1">
                    <p>Australian rock history has been evolving and developing for many decades, becoming one of the more favourited music genre in the country’s history. It was during the mid- to late-20th Century when the genre had become popularised, however, to the point that it was utilised to convey political standpoints. 
                        Generalised, the Australian rock music movement can be categorised into three ‘waves’, all occurring during the second half of the 1900’s. Before the 1950’s, Australian music, like many other countries, followed suit as the U.S. brought on the distribution of the concept of ‘rock n’ roll’, which in turn ignited the three waves to occur.

                    <p>First Wave: The first wave of the Australian rock movement is described as the emergence of the genre through British and American influence. Electric guitars and drums became key instruments that produced typical rock songs. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="historyText3">
                    <p>Second Wave: The second wave is evaluated through the ‘Beatles era’ context. Overseas, many rock bands of differing subgenres were reaching out their influence, such as the aforementioned Beatles and the Bee Gees. Arising from this wave was the notable Easybeats, an Australian rock band from the 1960’s.</p>

                <div class="historyText4">
                    <p>Third Wave: Throughout the 1970’s to 1990’s, the prominent rock style recognised today was developed through the influence of external and internal rock evolution. With different political situations and movements occurring from the 60’s to 90’s, the music of this time reflected the views of the general public at the time. Significant bands during this time were AD/DC and Cold Chisel. </p>
